## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google Fonts

### What I learned

This small challenge was useful for me as a way to learn how to use Git from the VS Code extension, user management and differences between global and local repos

Also it was useful to refine some of my skills since it has been a while since I've coded which helped me to polish concepts like CSS Box, flexbox and element centering.

### Continued development

I'd like to keep refining core concepts like flex and grid, before stepping into more complex learning elements like React library
